EZLFG

## Description
EZLFG will serve as an application for gamers to find groups to play multiplayer video games with. The web app will allow the user to create listings to form new groups as well as view listings created by other users and join their group. Most looking for group (LFG) applications are designed specifically, where EZLFG will be designed to work with many games just through one account. Users will be able to make an account which will allow them to link their account from other services containing their game ID (Steam, PlayStation, Xbox, Uplay, etc.). Users can select a game they wish to find a group for; once selecting that game they can then view listings for that game where each listing will contain a title, tags, group leader, start date/time, and end date/time.
